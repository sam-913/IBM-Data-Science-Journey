Each module folder includes Jupyter Notebooks containing:

Theory summaries

Code labs and practicals

Quiz solutions and assignments

Projects and portfolio pieces (especially in the Capstone folder)

📌 Key Highlights

Module 9 (Machine Learning): Includes comparative model evaluations—SVM, decision trees, KNN—with parameter tuning and reporting.

Applied Data Science Capstone: A full project from data collection and EDA to model deployment-ready outputs.

Clear naming conventions and well-commented notebooks, making your portfolio recruiter- and collaborator-ready.

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites
